/*
You have been given two integer arrays/lists (ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively.
You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists
contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.
Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.
The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the first sorted array/list (ARR1).

Sample Input 1 :
6
2 6 8 5 4 3
4
2 3 4 7 
Sample Output 1 :
2
3 
4
